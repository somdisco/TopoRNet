abstract={The self-organizing map (SOM) is a powerful method for visualization, cluster extraction, and data mining. It has been used successfully for data of high dimensionality and complexity where traditional methods may often be insufficient. In order to analyze data structure and capture cluster boundaries from the SOM, one common approach is to represent the SOM's knowledge by visualization methods. Different aspects of the information learned by the SOM are presented by existing methods, but data topology, which is present in the SOM's knowledge, is greatly underutilized. We show in this paper that data topology can be integrated into the visualization of the SOM and thereby provide a more elaborate view of the cluster structure than existing schemes. We achieve this by introducing a weighted Delaunay triangulation (a connectivity matrix) and draping it over the SOM. This new visualization, CONNvis, also shows both forward and backward topology violations along with the severity of forward ones, which indicate the quality of the SOM learning and the data complexity. CONNvis greatly assists in detailed identification of cluster boundaries. We demonstrate the capabilities on synthetic data sets and on a real 8D remote sensing spectral image.},

abstract = "Abstract A Hebbian adaptation rule with winner-take-all like competition is introduced. It is shown that this competitive Hebbian rule forms so-called Delaunay triangulations, which play an important role in computational geometry for efficiently solving proximity problems. Given a set of neural units i, i = 1,…, N, the synaptic weights of which can be interpreted as pointers wi, i = 1,…, N in RD, the competitive Hebbian rule leads to a connectivity structure between the units i that corresponds to the Delaunay triangulation of the set of pointers wi. Such competitive Hebbian rule develops connections (Cij > 0) between neural units i, j with neighboring receptive fields (Voronoi polygons) Vi, Vj, whereas between all other units i, j no connections evolve (Cij = 0). Combined with a procedure that distributes the pointers wi over a given feature manifold M, for example, a submanifold M ⊂ RD, the competitive Hebbian rule provides a novel approach to the problem of constructing topology preserving feature maps and representing intricately structured manifolds. The competitive Hebbian rule connects only neural units, the receptive fields (Voronoi polygons) Vi, Vj of which are adjacent on the given manifold M. This leads to a connectivity structure that defines a perfectly topology preserving map and forms a discrete, path preserving representation of M, also in cases where M has an intricate topology. This makes this novel approach particularly useful in all applications where neighborhood relations have to be exploited or the shape and topology of submanifolds have to be take into account."

The general approach of the simultaneous test procedures, available with a variety of statistical tests and for continuous as well as for categorical data, is employed with these techniques. Geographical regions are defined as sets of connected localities, with connectedness being defined geometrically. Maximal acceptable connected sets of localities (defined as regions) or coarsest acceptable connected partitions of the entire set of localities are found by these procedures. These are illustrated with several examples.},

As a topology representing graph, {\$}{\$}CADJ{\$}{\$}is an effective tool for cluster extraction from the learned prototypes of SOMs, but for complex data the graph must typically be pruned to elicit meaningful cluster structure. This work is a first attempt to guide this pruning in a formal modeling framework. Our model, dubbed DM-Prune, earmarks edges for removal via comparisons to a novel null model and provides an internal assessment of information loss resulting from iterative removal of edges.
